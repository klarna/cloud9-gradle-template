# Cloud9 Java Gradle template

You can use this project as a bootstrap in [Cloud9](chttps://c9.io), to get a
running Hello World Java project that you can run and test with Gradle.

To use it, simply create an account in Cloud9, go to your Dashboard, select
"Create New Workspace", and then select the "Clone from URL" option.
Paste the URL of this repository and click on "Create". 

Once your repository is created you will see a "Start editing" option on your
Dashboard. If you click there you will see a new window with an IDE-like
interface. Go to the terminal tab and run `source install-gradle.sh`.
This will install Gradle and set some environment variables. When the script
finishes you should be able to run `gradle clean run` and see a "Hello World"
message printed out in the console.

## Caveats
By default, when you create a new workspace it gets created with a "Micro" size.
This means that you get 512MB of RAM. 
Unfortunately Gradle is quite greedy and needs more than that for simple tasks.
So if you try to do a `gradle test` on this very basic project, Cloud9 will kill
the process and then Gradle will of course fail.
To solve this you have to manually resize your workspace to at least a "Medium"
size. You can see how to do that
[here](https://c9.io/site/blog/2015/02/workspace-stats).
